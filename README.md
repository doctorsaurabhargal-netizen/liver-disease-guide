# Liver Disease: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment Guide

The liver is one of the most important organs in the human body, responsible for detoxification, metabolism, digestion, and nutrient storage. Liver diseases often develop silently and may go unnoticed until they reach an advanced stage.

## Common Causes of Liver Disease
Liver disease can be caused by viral infections such as Hepatitis B and C, fatty liver disease related to obesity or diabetes, excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune disorders, and long-term use of certain medications.

## Symptoms of Liver Problems
Early liver disease may not present clear symptoms. As the condition progresses, common signs include fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort, jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, and swelling in the abdomen or legs.

## Importance of Early Diagnosis
Early diagnosis helps prevent irreversible liver damage such as cirrhosis or liver failure. Blood tests, imaging studies, and regular health check-ups play a crucial role in identifying liver problems at an early stage.

## Treatment and Management
Treatment of liver disease depends on the underlying cause and severity. Lifestyle changes, medications, dietary management, and regular medical monitoring are commonly recommended.
